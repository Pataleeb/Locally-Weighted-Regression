# Locally-Weighted-Regression

In this exercise, we will give more weight to data points in the training data that are close to the point at which we want to make a prediction. This can improve the bias but will also face a bias-variance tradeoff. We use the data in data.mat file. We also use 5-fold cross validation to tune the bandwidth parameter h.

Then we use the tuned hyper-paramter h to make a prediction for x=-1.
